Adapted From: America's Test Kitchen? (Unverified)

### Ingredients
* 3-1/3 cups all-purpose flour
* 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 sticks unsalted butter, melted & cooled
* 1-1/4 cups packed light brown sugar
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 2 large egg yolks
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1 (12 oz.) bag semisweet chocolate chips

### Directions
1. Adjust the oven racks to the upper- and lower-middle positions and heat the oven to 325 degrees. Whisk the flour, bakins soda, and salt together in a large bowl and set aside.
2. Beat the butter and sugars in a large bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla until combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down the bowl and beaters as needed.
3. Reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly mix in the flour mixture until combined, about 30 seconds. Mix in the chocolate chips until incorporated.
4. Working with 1/4 cup of dough at a time, roll the dough into balls and lay on two parchment-lined baking sheets, spaced about 2 1/2 inches apart. Bake until the edges are golden but the centers are still soft and puffy, 17-20 minutes, rotating and switching the baking sheets halfway through baking.
5. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes, then serve warm or transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
