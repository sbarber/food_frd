### Ingredients
* 4 slices thick-cut bacon, diced small
* 2 medium yellow onions, diced small
* 1 large red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced small
* 1-1/2 pounds ground turkey (85 percent lean) or a blend of ground thighs and breasts
* 3 tablespoons chili powder
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 tablespoon chopped garlic
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* Coarse salt and ground pepper
* 1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes
* 2 cans (15.5 ounces each) pinto beans, rinsed and drained
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro

### Directions
* In a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot, cook bacon over medium-high, stirring occasionally, until fat is rendered and bacon is crisp, about 8 minutes. Add onions and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften, about 3 minutes. Add turkey, chili powder, cumin, garlic, and oregano and cook, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until cooked through and lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
* Add tomatoes and juice, beans, and 2 cups water. Bring to a boil. Reduce to a rapid simmer, partially cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 20 minutes. (To store, refrigerate cooled chili in an airtight container, up to 3 days.) Serve topped with cilantro.
